## Customer Churn Prediction Model

#### Project Goal
The goal of this project is to identify major factors affecting customer churn, and predicting which e-commerce customers are likely to churn, (stop using the platform) our target variable in this dataset is "Churn".

We will develop a suitable model based on the data we have and have it perform automated predictions and send weekly notifications as to which customers are likely to churn, businesses can use this information to intervene when customers are likely to churn

By identifying at-risk customers early, the business can implement targeted retention strategies to reduce churn rates. Keeping customers is imoprtant for maintaining a steady revenue, enhancing customer lifetime value, and optimizing marketing efforts.

#### Problem Statement
An E-commerce business wants to predict which customers are likely to churn based on their past behaviour and interaction, so it can pro-actively make efforts to retain them (personalized marketing, service improvement).

Target column - Churn (1 = churned, 0 = retained)





### Points to note
+ __This project aims to make and improve model performance over time, iterating the data process to make sure the model becomes a bit better after every iteration.__
+ __Any missed step or detail in any of the notebooks can be brought up and improved, the project will see the continous improvement of the model and pipeline.__
+ __Some assumptions were made for the sake of this project, in a business setting, it would be more reasonable to ask for clarity or to get additional data from its source__
